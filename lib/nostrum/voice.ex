defmodule Nostrum.Voice do
  @moduledoc """
  Interface for playing audio through Discord's voice channels.

  # Using Discord Voice Channels
  To play sound in Discord with Nostrum, you'll need `ffmpeg` to be installed.
  If you don't have the executable `ffmpeg` in the path, the absolute path may
  be configured through config keys `:nostrum, :ffmpeg`. If you don't want to use
  ffmpeg, read on to the next section.

  A bot may be connected to at most one voice channel per guild. For this reason,
  most of the functions in this module take a guild id, and the resulting action
  will be performed in the given guild's voice channel that the bot is connected to.

  The primary Discord gateway responsible for all text based communication relies on
  one websocket connection per shard, where small bots typically only have one shard.
  The Discord voice gateways work by establishing a websocket connection per guild/channel.
  After some handshaking on this connection, audio data can be sent over UDP/RTP. Behind
  the scenes the voice websocket connections are implemented nearly the same way the main
  shard websocket connections are, and require no developer intervention.

  ## Voice Without FFmpeg
  If you wish to BYOE (Bring Your Own Encoder), there are a few options.
    - Use `:raw` as `type` for `Nostrum.Voice.play/4`
      - Provide the complete list of opus frames as the input
    - Use `:raw_s` as `type` for `Nostrum.Voice.play/4`
      - Provide a stateful enumerable of opus frames as input (think GenServer wrapped in `Stream.unfold/2`)
    - Use lower level functions to send opus frames at your leisure
      - Send packets on your own time using `Nostrum.Voice.send_frames/2`

  Plays sound in the voice channel the bot is in.

  The bot must be connected to a voice channel in the guild specified.

  ## Parameters
    - `guild_id` - ID of guild whose voice channel the sound will be played in.
    - `input` - Audio to be played. Type of `input` determined by `type` parameter.
    - `type` - Type of input (defaults to `:url`).
      - `:url` Input will be [any url that `ffmpeg` can read](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html).
      - `:pipe` Input will be data that is piped to stdin of `ffmpeg`.
      - `:ytdl` Input will be url for `youtube-dl`, which gets automatically piped to `ffmpeg`.
      - `:stream` Input will be livestream url for `streamlink`, which gets automatically piped to `ffmpeg`.
      - `:raw` Input will be an enumarable of raw opus frames. This bypasses `ffmpeg` and all options.
      - `:raw_s` Same as `:raw` but input must be stateful, i.e. calling `Enum.take/2` on input is not idempotent.
    - `options` - See options section below.


  Returns `{:error, reason}` if unable to play or a sound is playing, else `:ok`.

  ## Options
    - `:start_pos` (string) - The start position of the audio to be played. Defaults to beginning.
    - `:duration` (string) - The duration to of the audio to be played . Defaults to entire duration.
    - `:realtime` (boolean) - Make ffmpeg process the input in realtime instead of as fast as possible. Defaults to true.
    - `:volume` (number) - The output volume of the audio. Default volume is 1.0.
    - `:filter` (string) - Filter(s) to be applied to the audio. No filters applied by default.

    The values of `:start_pos` and `:duration` can be [any time duration that ffmpeg can read](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#Time-duration).
    The `:filter` can be used multiple times in a single call (see examples).
    The values of `:filter` can be [any audio filters that ffmpeg can read](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Audio-Filters).
    Filters will be applied in order and can be as complex as you want. The world is your oyster!

    Note that using the `:volume` option is shortcut for the "volume" filter, and will be added to the end of the filter chain, acting as a master volume.
    Volume values between `0.0` and `1.0` act as standard oparating range where `0` is off and `1` is max.
    Values greater than `1.0` will add saturation and distortion to the audio.
    Negative values act the same as their position but reverse the polarity of the waveform.

    Having all the ffmpeg audio filters available is *extremely powerful* so it may be worth learning some of them for your use cases.
    If you use any filters to *increase* the playback speed of your audio, it's recommended to set the `:realtime` option to `false`
    because realtime processing is relative to the original playback speed.
