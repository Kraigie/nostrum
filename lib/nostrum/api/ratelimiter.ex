defmodule Nostrum.Api.Ratelimiter do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles REST calls to the Discord API while respecting ratelimits.


  ## Purpose

  Discord's API returns information about ratelimits that we must respect. This
  module performs serialization of these requests through a single process,
  thus preventing concurrency issues from arising if two processes make a
  remote API call at the same time.


  > ### Internal module {: .info}
  >
  > This module is intended for exclusive usage inside of nostrum, and is
  > documented for completeness and people curious to look behind the covers.


  ## Asynchronous requests

  The ratelimiter is fully asynchronous internally. In theory, it also supports
  queueing requests in an asynchronous manner. However, support for this is
  currently not implemented in `Nostrum.Api`.

  If you want to make one or multiple asynchronous requests manually, you can
  use the following pattern:

  ```elixir
  req = :gen_statem.send_request(Nostrum.Api.Ratelimiter, {:queue, request})
  # ...
  response = :gen_statem.receive_response(req, timeout)
  ```

  where `request` is a map describing the request to run - see `Nostrum.Api`
  for more information. You can also send multiple requests at the same time
  and wait for their response: see `:gen_statem.reqids_add/3` and
  `:gen_statem.wait_response/3` for more information.


  ## Multi-node

  If a single global process is desired to handle all ratelimiting, the
  ratelimiter can theoretically be adjusted to start registered via `:global`.
  In practice, it may be more beneficial to have a local ratelimiter process on
  each node and either using the local one for any API calls, or using a
  consistent hash mechanism to distribute API requests around the cluster as
  needed.


  ## Inner workings

  When a client process wants to perform some request on the Discord API, it
  sends a request to the `:gen_statem` behind this module to ask it to `:queue`
  the incoming request.


  ### Connection setup

  If the state machine is not connected to the HTTP endpoint, it will
  transition to the `:connecting` state and try to open the connection. If this
  succeeds, it transitions to the `:connected` state.

  The state machine associates a `t::queue.queue/1` of `t:queued_request/0` to
  each individual bucket, together with an internal count of remaining calls.
  If an entry is found with remaining calls above 0, the request is scheduled
  for immediate execution. If an entry is found with remaining calls of 0, or
  with the special `:initial` value (indicating that the initial request to
  find the ratelimit just headed out), it is queued. Otherwise, if no entry is
  found, a new queue is created with an `:initial` remaining call count, and
  the request scheduled for immediate execution.

  The request starting function, `:next`, will start new requests from the
  queue as long as more calls are possible in the timeframe. Any requests are
  then started asynchronously. Bookkeeping is set up to associate the resulting
  `t::gun.stream_ref/0` with the original client along with its request and the
  ratelimiter bucket.

  Results from the HTTP connection are delivered non-blocking: simple responses
  with purely status codes and no body (code `204`) will be sent in a single
  message, other requests will be sent to us incrementally. To finally deliver
  the full response body to the client with the final package, an internal
  buffer of the body is kept. A possible future optimization could be having a
  way for `:gun` to only send the ratelimiter state machine the initial
  `:gun_response` and forward any item of the body directly to the client.

  When the headers for a request have been received, the ratelimiter parses the
  ratelimit information and starts off an internal timer expiring when the
  ratelimits expire. It will also reschedule calls with the `:next` internal
  event for as many remaining calls as it knows about. Once the timer expires
  for the current bucket, two cases can happen:

  - The queue has items: Schedule all items and repeat this later.

  - The queue is empty: Delete the queue and remaining calls from the outstanding buckets.

  In practice, this means that we never store more information than we need,
  and removes the previous regular bucket sweeping functionality that the
  ratelimit buckets required.

  **Global ratelimits** are handled with the special `global_limit` state. This
  state is only entered with a state timeout, the state timeout being the
  `X-Ratelimit-Reset-After` value provided in the global ratelimit response.
  This state does nothing apart from postponing any events it receives and
  returning to the previous state (`:connected`) once the global timeout is
  gone.


  ### Failure modes

  #### HTTP connection death

  If the HTTP connection dies, the ratelimiter will inform each affected client
  by replying with `{:error, {:connection_died, reason}}`, where `reason` is
  the reason as provided by the `:gun_down` event. It will then transition to
  `:disconnected` state. If no requests were running at time the connection was
  shut down - for instance, because we simply reached the maximum idle time on
  the HTTP/2 connection - we will simply move on.

  #### Upstream errors

  The ratelimiter works by queueing requests aggressively as soon as it has
  ratelimit information to do so. If no ratelimit information is available, for
  instance, because Discord returned us a 502 status code, the ratelimiter will
  not automatically kick the queue to start further running requests.

  #### Other internal issues

  Any other internal problems that are not handled appropriately in the
  ratelimiter will crash it, effectively resulting in the complete loss of any
  queued requests.


  ### Implementation benefits & drawbacks

  #### A history of ratelimiting

  First, it is important to give a short history of nostrum's ratelimiting: pre
  `0.8`, nostrum used to use a `GenServer` that would call out to ETS tables to
  look up ratelimiting buckets for requests. If it needed to sleep before
  issuing a request due to the bucket being exhausted, it would do so in the
  server process and block other callers. 

  In nostrum 0.8, the existing ratelimiter bucket storage architecture was
  refactored to be based around the [pluggable caching
  functionality](../advanced/pluggable_caching.md), and buckets with no
  remaining calls were adjusted to be slept out on the client-side by having
  the `GenServer` respond to the client with `{:error, {:retry_after, millis}}`
  and the client trying again and again to schedule its requests. This allowed
  users to distribute their ratelimit buckets around however they wish, out of
  the box, nostrum shipped with an ETS and a Mnesia-based ratelimit bucket
  store.


  #### Problems we solved

  The approach above still came with a few problems:

  - Requests were still being done synchronously in the ratelimiter, and it was
  blocked from anything else whilst running the requests, even though we are
  theoretically free to start requests for other buckets while one is still
  running.

  - The ratelimiter itself was half working on its own, but half required the
  external storage mechanisms, which made the code hard to follow and required
  regular automatic pruning because the store had no idea when a bucket was no
  longer relevant on its own.

  - Requests would not be pipelined to run as soon as ideally possible.

  - The ratelimiter did not inform clients if their request died in-flight.

  - If the client disconnected before we returned the response, we had to
  handle this explicitly via `handle_info`.

  The new state machine-based ratelimiter solves these problems.
